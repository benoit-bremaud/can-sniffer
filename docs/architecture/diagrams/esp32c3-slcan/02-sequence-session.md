# Sequence diagram — a capture session over slcan

## Context

One full session, from the application opening the serial device to the frames reaching the
decoder. The host side is python-can's slcan backend driven by `PythonCanAdapter`; nothing in
the application is specific to this firmware, which is the point of implementing the protocol
rather than inventing one.

## Notes

- Every command is answered. An adapter that stays silent makes "applied" indistinguishable
  from "ignored", which is precisely what cost a full day of diagnosis on the CANable and
  what forced #48 to ship an explicit "accept unverified silence" opt-in.
- The codec never emits a line beginning with `t`, `T`, `r`, `R` or `x` other than a genuinely
  received frame, so the host can never mistake a diagnostic for traffic.
- `F` is answered from the TWAI counters with the LAWICEL status byte. It is polled, not
  pushed: slcan carries no error frame, and no firmware can change that.
- The receive loop is bounded per iteration and the driver queue is deeper than the bench
  profiles need, but a saturated bus will still drop frames, silently, as slcan always does.
