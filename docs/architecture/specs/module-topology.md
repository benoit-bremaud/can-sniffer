# Module topology decoding

> **Status**: implemented for Issue [#37](https://github.com/benoit-bremaud/can-sniffer/issues/37)
>
> **Protocol reference**: *Charger module CAN Communication Protocol V1.13*, commands
> `0x02` and `0x04`

## Goal

Allow an operator to identify how many Infypower charger modules report belonging to a
system or group and to identify the group number reported by an individual module. The
feature extends passive decoding only: it never discovers devices actively and never sends
a CAN frame.

## Scope

- Decode the reported module count from byte 2 of a valid command `0x02` response.
- Decode the module group number from byte 2 of a valid command `0x04` response.
- Preserve the existing ambient-temperature and state decoding for command `0x04`.
- Surface both values through the existing live-capture, replay, display, and CSV-analysis
  paths.

Module discovery, topology history, change detection, query transmission, module versions,
extended diagnostics, and barcode decoding are outside this feature.

## Protocol interpretation

Semantic decoding is allowed only when the existing identifier validation succeeds and the
payload contains exactly eight bytes.

| Command | Payload byte 2 | Context retained from the identifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x02` | Unsigned module count in the addressed system or group | Device number and source address distinguish system and group responses |
| `0x04` | Unsigned group number reported by the source module | Source address identifies the reporting module |

Values are decoded as unsigned bytes. Therefore, the decoder accepts the complete wire range
from 0 through 255 without adding a stricter rule that the protocol does not state for these
response fields. Reserved payload bytes remain uninterpreted.

## Domain design

`DecodeResult` remains the immutable aggregate returned by the pure `ProtocolDecoder`. It gains
two optional scalar fields:

- `module_count: int | None`
- `module_group_number: int | None`

For command `0x02`, only `module_count` is populated. For command `0x04`, only
`module_group_number` is populated. Other commands and invalid payload lengths leave both
fields unset.

A separate topology entity, service, repository, factory, or protocol interface is deliberately
not introduced. The feature adds two independent scalar facts to an existing immutable result,
has no new I/O boundary, and requires no runtime variation. Direct fields are therefore the
smallest design that preserves type clarity and the Clean Architecture dependency rule.

## Presentation

When decoded-value display is enabled, the existing presentation paths append stable labels:

- `Modules=<count>` for command `0x02`;
- `Group=<number>` for command `0x04`.

The group label appears before the existing ambient-temperature and state information for a
command `0x04` result. Numeric precision settings do not affect integer topology values. When
decoded-value display is disabled, no topology label is shown, while the retained
`DecodeResult` remains unchanged.

## Error handling

- Invalid, standard, or CAN error frames retain the existing diagnostics and expose no topology
  values.
- Payloads shorter or longer than eight bytes retain the existing payload-length diagnostic and
  expose no topology values.
- Unsupported commands remain valid generic Infypower results but expose no topology values.
- A zero value is valid wire data and must not be confused with a missing value.

## Test strategy

Fast, isolated unit tests exercise the pure decoder and existing presenters without CAN hardware
or mocks of domain code.

| Category | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Happy path | Documented system count 7, documented group count 3, and command `0x04` group 2 with ambient temperature 27 °C and existing state decoding preserved |
| Sad path | Short and oversized payloads expose neither topology field and retain diagnostics; unrelated commands expose neither field |
| Edge cases | Counts and group numbers 0 and 255 remain unsigned and distinguishable from `None`; decoded-value hiding suppresses labels |
| Regression | Existing protocol, live display, replay, CSV export, state, and temperature tests remain green |

Total project coverage must remain at least 90%, and pytest, Ruff, and strict mypy must pass.

## Traceability

| Requirement | Design realization | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decode command `0x02` count | `DecodeResult.module_count` and the `0x02` decoder branch | Protocol happy-path and boundary tests |
| Complete command `0x04` topology | `DecodeResult.module_group_number` in the existing `0x04` branch | Combined group, temperature, and state test |
| Preserve Clean dependencies | Pure decoder result consumed by existing presenters | Import review and unit tests without infrastructure |
| Fail safely | Exact payload-length gate before semantic decoding | Short and oversized payload tests |
| Avoid speculative design | No new boundary, service, or pattern | Architecture review |
