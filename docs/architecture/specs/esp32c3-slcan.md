# ESP32-C3 slcan sniffer profile

> **Feature**: [Issue #50](https://github.com/benoit-bremaud/can-sniffer/issues/50)
> **Status**: conception approved 2026-09-11 and implemented in the same pull request.
> The protocol was exercised on the board; capture against real traffic is outstanding.

## Purpose and boundary

Turn the ESP32-C3 into a receive-only CAN adapter whose silence is guaranteed by the
controller rather than promised by a command, so `can_sniffer` can observe a bus nobody owns
through the backend shipped in #49, with no application change.

It does not transmit, decode charger protocols, determine an unknown bitrate, or deliver bus
error frames. The bench generator profiles are untouched.

## Problem

`docs/hardware/canable-2.0.md` records that the CANable's SLCAN firmware does not guarantee
the LAWICEL `L` command and acknowledges no command at all, which is why #49 had to make
listen-only an explicit operator acceptance rather than a verified fact. The adapter also
stopped communicating on 2026-09-11.

The ESP32-C3 already on the bench offers what that firmware cannot. The SDK defines
`TWAI_MODE_LISTEN_ONLY` as a controller mode that "will not influence the bus (No
transmissions or acknowledgments) but can receive messages" — enforced by the peripheral.

## Requirements

- L1: No transmit path exists. `t`, `T`, `r`, `R` and `x` are answered with BEL in every
  state, and no code in the profile submits a frame. This is what makes the image pointable
  at a bus the operator does not own, unlike the generator profiles.
- L2: `L` installs `TWAI_MODE_LISTEN_ONLY`; `O` installs `TWAI_MODE_NORMAL`, which
  acknowledges and exists for the two-node bench where nothing else would acknowledge the
  generator. The active mode is reported, never assumed.
- L3: Every command is answered — CR on success, BEL on refusal — including a bare
  terminator, which python-can writes on every `set_bitrate`. A silent adapter makes
  "applied" indistinguishable from "ignored", which is what made the CANable undiagnosable
  and cost a full day of bench time, so the rule admits no exception.
- L4: Only rates the controller can produce are accepted. It offers 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k,
  125k, 250k, 500k, 800k and 1M, so exactly two codes are refused: `S9` at 83.3k, absent from
  the SDK, and `S7`, which LAWICEL and the SDK read as 800k while python-can sends it for
  750k. An ambiguous code is refused rather than resolved by assumption, and no code is ever
  substituted by a neighbour.
- L5: A bitrate is accepted only while the channel is closed, and opening an open channel is
  refused. The controller cannot retime a running channel, so accepting either would report a
  configuration that was never applied.
- L6: `C` always reaches the driver and reports what cleanup actually returned. Closing a
  closed channel succeeds, but the command is never short-circuited: an earlier cleanup may
  have failed with the driver still installed, and `C` is the only command able to retry it.
- L6b: The receive queue holds 32 frames in listen-only mode. One slot suits the generator
  profiles, which keep a single frame in flight; a sniffer must absorb a burst between two
  loop iterations, and the driver silently counts what it drops.
- L7: The profile writes protocol bytes and nothing else. No banner, no status line, no
  logger — any human-readable output would arrive inside the frame stream and be parsed by
  the host as traffic.
- L8: `F` answers the LAWICEL status byte built from the driver counters: receive overrun,
  error-passive derived from the 128 threshold, arbitration lost, bus error and bus-off. When
  no snapshot is readable it reports no flags rather than inventing them.
- L9: A start that fails releases the driver, so a later open cannot fail for a reason
  unrelated to the bus. `F` on a closed channel reports no flags rather than replaying the
  previous session's, since the driver snapshot deliberately survives cleanup. A frame with a non-compliant DLC is clamped to eight rather than
  driving a read past the payload.

## Design

`lib/bench/slcan.{h,cpp}` holds the protocol: a line parser, a frame encoder, the status byte
and the session that drives a channel. It includes no SDK header, so all of it runs under the
native suite. The session talks to `SlcanChannelPort`, whose two implementations are
`TwaiSlcanChannel` in production and a double in tests — the same shape as `CanPort`.

`bench::Bitrate` was extended to name every rate the controller can produce and is now the
single source of truth shared by the codec, the adapter and the scenarios; `TwaiPort` maps
each to its SDK timing config and refuses anything outside the enum.

`BENCH_SLCAN` selects the profile, mutually exclusive with the other four and rejected at
compile time alongside `BENCH_NO_ACK`, which fabricates acknowledgements and is the opposite
of what a receive-only sniffer promises. The loop reads a
bounded number of input bytes, then drains a bounded number of frames, and writes only what
the session returns.

## Verification and traceability

| Requirement | Automated evidence | Hardware evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Transmit refused in every state; `sdk.transmits` stays zero | `T…` and `t…` answered BEL on the board |
| L2 | Mode reaching the driver asserted per request | `L` accepted, mode installed |
| L3 | Every command's exact reply asserted | Every reply observed over USB |
| L4 | Each supported code maps to its own timing config; `S7`/`S9` refused | `S4` accepted, `S7`/`S9` refused |
| L5, L6 | Bitrate and reopen refused while open; close idempotent, reaches the port, and a refused cleanup is reported | Both observed on the board |
| L7 | Output asserted byte-exact, empty until spoken to | No human-readable byte seen |
| L8 | Each counter mapped to its flag; unreadable snapshot yields zero | `F00` before and after a session |
| L9 | Failed start uninstalls; DLC above eight clamped | — |

Native coverage of authored code stays at or above 90%; all six images must build.

### What the bench can and cannot prove

The protocol was exercised on the board and every designed behaviour matched. Capture against
real traffic was **not** proven: the bench holds a single node, since the ESP32 is the sniffer
and the CANable that would generate traffic is disconnected and suspected faulty. Zero frames
captured is the expected result there, not a passing test.

That `L` actually silences the adapter on the wire also remains unproven, and can only be
shown on a bus carrying two other active nodes. The difference from #49 is the nature of the
guarantee: here silence is a controller mode the SDK defines, not a command a third-party
firmware may ignore.

## Known limitation

slcan is text over a serial link. An extended frame costs 27 characters, so the USB CDC link
is comfortable at bench cadence but a saturated bus will outrun it, and the protocol reports
neither the loss nor any bus error — `F` is polled, not pushed. Exhaustive capture and real
error frames need an adapter exposing a native CAN interface.
